\section{Introduction}

Bosch Sensortec offers a toolkit for evaluation of it's sensor products.The toolkit consists of 3 elements:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Engineering board}: \href{https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/support_tools/application_boards/overview_application_boards}{Application Board} named APP2.0 and APP3.x in this document, serves as interface translator from the sensor interface (I\textsuperscript{2}C or SPI) to a USB interface, allowing PC software to communicate with the sensor on the shuttle board. \href{https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-sense-me}{Nicla Sense ME} board combines four state-of-the-art sensors from Bosch Sensortec (BHI260AP, BMP390, BMM150 and BME688) in the Arduino ecosystem.

	\end{figure}

	\item \textbf{Sensor Shuttle board}: A sensor specific shuttle board also known as breakout board is a PCB with the sensor mounted on it. The shuttle board allows easy access to the sensor pins via a simple socket and can be directly plugged into the Bosch Sensortecâ€™s Application boards. APP3.x shuttle boards also known as mini shuttle boards has smaller form factor when compared with APP2.0 shuttle board.

	\end{figure}

	\item \textbf{COINES}: COINES provides a low-level interface for communication with Bosch Sensortec's Engineering boards enabling access to their MEMS sensors through sample applications and SensorAPI. For detailed description, refer to sections below.

\section{Using COINESPY to access the sensor on Engineering Board}

\subsection{Introduction to \texttt{COINESPY} library}

The \texttt{COINESPY} library provides a Python interface for interacting with the Bosch Sensortec's Engineering Boards. 
\newline \newline The library offers the following range of functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Control VDD and VDDIO of sensor
	\item Configure SPI and I\textsuperscript{2}C bus parameters
	\item Read and write into registers of sensors from Bosch Sensortec via SPI and I\textsuperscript{2}C
	\item Read and write digital pins of the Application Board
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

The \texttt{COINESPY} module can be installed using pip:
\begin{lstlisting}
pip install coinespy
\end{lstlisting}
The module can be found on \url{https://pypi.org/project/coinespy/}.
It is highly recommended to test the following script \texttt{examples\textbackslash python\textbackslash coinespy\_test.py}  in the COINES installation or Refer to \ref{GettingBoardInfo} to check if the installation was successful.

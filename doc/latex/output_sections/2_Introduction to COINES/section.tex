\section{Introduction to COINES}

COINES ("\textbf{CO}mmunication with \textbf{IN}ertial and \textbf{E}nvironmental \textbf{S}ensors") is an SDK (Software Development Kit), implemented in C as a programming language that provides a low-level interface to Bosch Sensortec's Engineering Boards. The user can access Bosch Sensortec's MEMS sensors through this C interface. COINES can be used with the SensorAPI of the sensor which is available at \url{https://github.com/BoschSensortec}. The user can modify, compile and run the sample applications in COINES SDK and SensorAPI.


The full working environment consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Bosch Sensortec MEMS sensor on a shuttle board mounted on the socket of Bosch Sensortec's Application board APP2.0/APP3.x
	\item Windows, Linux or Mac PC to which the Engineering Board is connected via USB or BLE.
	\item The release of the COINES software is available at \url{https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/tools/coines/}
	\item C compiler is also required (for details, see sections below)
\end{itemize}
